####This week's goal:
*Computer assisted animation/illustration (due 1 April 2015)*

To kick off 2015, my writing whip partner and I decided to take on a new challenge: learning new skills. We would maintain the same weekly meeting schedule and method, but instead of completing (or talking about how to complete) our writing assignments, would assign ourselves a new skill to learn within one or two weeks time. By the time the due date rolls around, we should have completed a task which indicates that a new skills has been learned.

Below are the goals that I have assigned myself for 2015 - we'll see how many I get through before the end of the year.

####Web Development
* Create a blog site using Markdown
 * [**DONE**](http://craigwiggins.github.io)

####Video
* Set up personal YouTube presence
* Create a series of short (3 mins or less - probably way less) videos on weekly themes

####Programming language explorations
* Properly set up a Github presence and test it
 * [**DONE**](https://github.com/craigwiggins/hello-world)
* Code Academy
* Beginner projects in Python

####Learning technology
* Figure out how to use Conducttr
* Figure out how to use ARIS
* Create a very small situated documentary
* [Experience API](http://xapi.adlnet.gov) explorations
 * Set up an LRS
 * Experiment with an authoring tool that will create xAPI statements
 * Create small interaction that will express said statements
 * Verify that statements were captured in an LRS
 * Install the Learning Locker LRS on a Raspberry Pi

####Other (mostly unformed ideas)
* Get into [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)
* Plan (not build) a reasonably complex transmedia experience
* Create a proof-of-concept using inklewriter
 * [**DONE**](https://writer.inklestudios.com/stories/qj2z)
* Learn to read and write in [hangul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)
* Knot tying

####Computer-assisted illustration/animation
* AfterEffects for motion graphics
* Pencil2D using the Wacom Bamboo tablet
