[**James C. Lewis**](http://www.noire3000studios.com/bio-contact)'s famous [*Yoruba African Orishas* photo shoot](http://images.us.viewbook.com/272bb78b0573281eeb55793afcfc3232_small.jpg).

I love that this was done, especially since most renderings of orixás/loas are either symbolic or totally committed to syncretism with, say, Catholicism. That said, I almost wish that the strangeness of specificity of photography could been channeled into something more purposeful.
