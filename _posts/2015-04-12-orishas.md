[**James C. Lewis**](http://www.noire3000studios.com/bio-contact)'s famous [*Yoruba African Orishas* photo shoot](http://www.noire3000studios.com/album/yorubaafricanorishas?p=1).

I love that this was done, especially since most renderings of [orixás](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orisha)/[loas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loa) are either symbolic or totally committed to syncretism with, say, Catholicism. That said, I almost wish that the strangeness of specificity of photography could been channeled into something more purposeful.
