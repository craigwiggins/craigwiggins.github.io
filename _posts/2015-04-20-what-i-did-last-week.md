title: what I did last week (week of 13 April 2015)
---

Man, I am so tired right now.

But I want to get this down before my eyes shut (sleep? pollen? hard to tell at this point). Let's do it.

###money earnin'

* Participated in the [CMI-5 Sandstone Working Group](http://www.adlnet.gov/index.html%3Fp=12527.html) meeting. ([Check out the Storify](https://storify.com/oxala75/cmi-5-working-group-meeting) that I made to try to summarize day one of the event.)
* [xAPI Design Cohort](https://groups.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/forum/#!forum/xapi-design)! The usual: updates, team meetings, video editing. Shout out to [Jonathan Kevan](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jon-kevan/2/21b/a41) for showing off Team DCDC's progress!
* Planning the upcoming xAPI Bootcamp. Details forthcoming!
* Thinking about what an ADL 'xAPI 101' would look like; spending time thinking about how to flesh out the existing [SCORM-to-TLA Roadmap](http://adlnet.github.io/SCORM-to-TLA-Roadmap/)

###book learnin'
* I took the train up to Rockville to [visit the Thingstitute](http://craigwiggins.github.io/2015/04/20/the-thingstitute/). Beacons, Raspberry Pi(es?), many, many cables. Lost a dongle or two. Totally worth it.
* [Rope burns](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexbasics.php)
* [The CMI-5 spec](https://github.com/AICC/CMI-5_Spec_Current). I've actually read the entire thing a few times now - rather useful, I think. Kind of makes me want to re-read the [xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec). You know, for laughs.
* [Bootsnip](http://bootsnipp.com/) - an element gallery for web designers and web developers, containing design elements, playground and code snippets for the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) HTML/CSS/JS framework
* Jekyll has been great (it's brought me this site, at least), but I think [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) may be my next conquest. 

###blunt burnin'
* I did not, in the end, purchase the [MF Doom mystery box](http://www.factmag.com/2015/04/12/mf-doom-akomplice-mystery-box/). IDC IDC IDC
* This doesn't really count as last week (it came out about 7 hours ago), but [daaamn, Michael Eric Dyson](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121550/cornel-wests-rise-fall-our-most-exciting-black-scholar-ghost).

ok, it's after 0100 EDT on a Monday. I gotta be awake in a few. Catch you later.
