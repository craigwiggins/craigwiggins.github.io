title: what I did this week (28 March 2015)
---

Rachel Barnum - you know, [*that Rachel*](http://www.ohthatrachel.com/) - had what I thought was a good idea: [a weekly recap](http://www.ohthatrachel.com/2015/03/27/what-ive-been-up-to-this-week/). I liked it so much that i'mma steal it ([I told her so](https://twitter.com/oxala75/status/581470914237333504)).

Here's what I've been up to:

* I [twitter stalked](http://craigwiggins.github.io/2015/03/25/xAPI-Camp/) the inaugural Connections Forum [xAPI Camp](http://connectionsforum.com/xapi-camp-march-2015/)
* After having started 2015 by watching [*Cloud Atlas*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_(film)), I have continued making my way through [David Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mitchell_%28author%29)'s novels. Currently on [*Black Swan Green*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_Green)
* Started spinning up the engines for the upcoming [CMI-5 Working Group meeting](http://www.adlnet.gov/cmi-5-sandstone-pre-release-working-group-april-15-16/)
* Continued to work on the [whip list](http://craigwiggins.github.io/the-whip/). This week: working the [Wacom](http://us.wacom.com/en/welcome/bamboo-connect/) and [Pencil2D](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil)
* [xAPI Design Cohort - week 8](https://groups.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/forum/#!forum/xapi-design)! 
* Jealously followed [#LSCon tweets](https://twitter.com/LSCon)
* Sat in on the Medbiquitous xAPI Interest Group meeting. This week's subject: [inaction and xAPI](http://groups.medbiq.org/medbiq/display/XIG/Discussion+on+inaction)
* Started planning ADL webinar series. (Hey, btw - what do *you* want to know about what ADL is up to?)
* [Learning Circles Open Mic Friday](https://youtu.be/mz8H2Xyn1R4) with my co-hosts [Brent Schlenker](https://twitter.com/bschlenker) and [Enzo Silva](https://twitter.com/enzofsilva). ([links from the show](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CraigWiggins/posts/aDTYPTfg8bG))
