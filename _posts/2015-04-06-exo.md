Set a decade in the future in the Lagos Island-inspired Lagoon City, part one of the superhero series sees Wale inheriting a Nanosuit which gives him superhuman abilities that he uses to protect the city from The C.R.E.E.D, a radical extremist organization that aims to eradicate Lagoon City’s “myopic government.”
