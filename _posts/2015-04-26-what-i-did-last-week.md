title: what I did last week (week of 20 April 2015)

I don't know what to say about this week. Kind of feeling like I'm falling off.

###money earnin'

* Lots of video editing. I've been trying to get at a lot the questions that people have (well, that I think that they should have) about what [ADL](http://www.adlnet.gov) does. For example, what is [cmi5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlv_yyODMQs5t2aom5cYp1Z5Dv6BxMVkg)?
* Writing! Made it back to the keyboard to try to finish something. Writing in narrative takes some time (for me, anyway), but I hope that I'll have something to share with you all soon.
* xAPI Vocabulary Working Group. TBH, this is really led by Jason Haag, but I tagged along :) Really, it's important work for the specification, and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes up at the end of the two month stretch.

###book learnin'
* [*The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thousand_Autumns_of_Jacob_de_Zoet) is finished. In the hour (!) that it took me to realize that there's another [Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mitchell_(author)) book before [*The Bone Clocks*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bone_Clocks), found out that there is [a subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/david_mitchell) dedicated to David Mitchell. This is my new life goal: I want a subreddit.
* [Koding University](http://learn.koding.com). Yep.

###blunt burnin'
* I...actually have nothing here. Well, except for [this](http://www.shareably.net/perfect-road-trip-map/).
