Sometimes when I step back from being an xAPI evangelist to survey the landscape, I am reminded that not only can you not make a horse drink, some horses really weren't meant to drink from anything but the trough. If we're sticking with the metaphor, xAPI is for those willing to follow rivers to their sources. 

Here's the thing, though: I kind of don't blame the trough horses. There's a wide world of opportunities, risks, and incremental rewards and failures that sit between the stable and the river in the valley. Even fewer horses are led to the source.
