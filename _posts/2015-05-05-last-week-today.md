* I can honestly say that - for money - I spent a day and a half at least 50% engaged in contemplative activity that I legally cannot talk about. It is not nearly as shady as my previous phrasing will have led you to believe.
* Got the registration site for the xAPI Bootcamp 2015 up and running; looking to announce it in a few days.
* Spent a fair amount of time thinking about how to create a graduated xAPI kiddie pool experience for US federal government employees...and then [Will Constantine](https://twitter.com/willconstantine) comes out here with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/willconstantine/status/593575652856467456) and then I'm all

I mean, he's right, but it really got me thinking about how hard and under which circumstances I should be trying so hard to evangelize. (Kinda messes with the day job, but I really do want to be true to my people.)
* Getting ready for my [eLearning Guild Online Forum session](http://www.elearningguild.com/content.cfm?selection=doc.3814) (with [Robert Gadd](https://twitter.com/robgadd4))

* [*The Bone Clocks*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bone_Clocks), is finished. Admittedly, I was kinda like

No more David Mitchell until the end of October, unless I want to [hunt down the short stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2rez91/hard_to_find_short_stories_by_david_mitchell/).
* I've been a big fan of [Dr Meredith Clark](https://twitter.com/meredithclark) for a minute - probably since I started seeing her retweeted in that one Tweetdeck hashtag column ([you know the one](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blacktwitter)). Was interested to read her sharing her take on [a common concern](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/the-truth-about-black-twitter/390120/):

> **Donovan X. Ramsey:** How do you define Black Twitter?
> **Meredith Clark:** I define Black Twitter as a temporally linked group of connectors that share culture, language and interest in specific issues and talking about specific topics with a black frame of reference. ... I break Black Twitter down into three levels of connection: personal community, and that reflects the people that you are connected with in some other dimension other than Twitter. And I take that personal community from Barry Wellman's work. The second level I find is thematic notes, and that's where individuals specifically tweet together about certain topics, so they keep returning to this subject matter. And those thematic notes could be anything from television shows, to ideologies, topics of religion. They might be centric to where these individuals are in a certain part of the country. It just kind of all depends on what topic we're interested in. And then that third level of connection, where we see a lot of conversation about these networks and how they're linked, is when those personal communities and the thematic notes kind of intersect around a specific topic.
