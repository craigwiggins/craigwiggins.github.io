> *The [African superhero](http://www.okayafrica.com/news/nigerian-superhero-graphic-novel-exo-the-legend-of-wale-williams-roye-okupe/) universe continues to widen with the emergence of a comic book series from South Africa. [Kwezi](http://kwezicomics.co.za/), which means “star” in Xhosa and Zulu, is the brainchild of Loyiso Mkize, a designer and fine artist who got his start in comics as an illustrator for the long-running [Supa Strikas](http://www.supastrikas.co.za/) soccer series. Mkize describes Kwezi as “a coming of age story about finding one’s heritage.”*
