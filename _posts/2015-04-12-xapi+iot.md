From the registration website:

> *Connecting devices together so that they can communicate and interact is a new frontier for technological innovation.  We’re looking for skilled and creative individuals to help us innovate!*

> *Join 50+ of your fellow programmers, developers, and digital enthusiasts, and build programs that combine the power of proximity beacons and micro-computer technologies – so called Internet of Things (IoT) – with the new [Experience API (xAPI)](http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/) that can track learning and training activity in innovative ways!*

> *Calling all programmers and IoT enthusiasts! Join us in building open source interoperable data applications for IoT hardware. The purpose of this hackathon is to explore the application of the Experience API (xAPI) open data standard to Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This event will support the work of a volunteer [NIST / US Ignite Global City action cluster](https://us-ignite.org/globalcityteams/actioncluster/NSkmt5PEY5iTYgweMCPvRd/) in developing an open ecosystem of IoT technologies to be deployed in emergency and medical simulation training exercises.*
