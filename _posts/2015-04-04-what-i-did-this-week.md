This week was about a lot of

and not so much of

Anyway, Rachel - yes, [*that Rachel*](http://www.ohthatrachel.com/) - is [already back at it](http://www.ohthatrachel.com/2015/04/03/what-ive-been-up-to-this-week-2/). I like the idea of making this a regular thing, so let's get to it:

* Finished [David Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mitchell_%28author%29)'s [*Black Swan Green*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_Green); immediately downloaded and began his [*The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thousand_Autumns_of_Jacob_de_Zoet). I'm not far in, but a lot about what I'm reading makes me think about the Dutch character (in just one episode?) that was in [*Samurai Champloo*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Champloo).
* Fulfilled my most recent [whip list](http://craigwiggins.github.io/the-whip/) challenge: working the [Wacom](http://us.wacom.com/en/welcome/bamboo-connect/) and [Pencil2D](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil). [Here's what I wrote about it](http://craigwiggins.github.io/2015/04/04/reacquaintance/) (and a not-yet-great sample of what can be accomplished with [Krita](https://krita.org/)). I don't know which [whip list](http://craigwiggins.github.io/the-whip/) item I shold tackle next. [Let me know](http://www.twitter.com/oxala75)?
* [xAPI Design Cohort - week 9](https://groups.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/forum/#!forum/xapi-design)! 
* Spent way, way, way too much time messing with the management settings for ADL's YouTube account(s). I'm beginning to understand why people are moving to [Vessel](https://www.vessel.com/) or evening *paying* to use [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).
* xAPI Thursday! 
 * Regular xAPI Design Cohort 0700 meeting. Shout out to [Andrew Downes](https://twitter.com/mrdownes) for the company!
 * I spoke very, very quickly about the Experience API in front of a crowd of about 50 people for the [Talent Development Requirements Development Working Group](http://clo.knowledgeportal.us/minutes/8th-annual-chief-learning-officer-council-strategic-planning-meeting-1/clo-talent-dev-reqs) meeting at [ADL](http://www.adlnet.gov) Alexandria. The group asked me (and all of the speakers) a lot of good questions. I hope to have a Storify of the event up soon.
 * xAPI Design Cohort 1500 EDT meeting. The usual, though I don't have any videos to show for it this time around (sorry Rachel).
* Watched the [*Kirkpatrick Model Good or Bad? The Epic Mega Battle Continues...*](https://youtu.be/nXHNUX-HuVs) with [Clark Quinn](http://blog.learnlets.com/) and [Will Thalheimer](http://www.willatworklearning.com/2015/03/kirkpatrick-model-good-or-bad-the-epic-mega-battle.html) about [Kirkpatricks 4 Levels of Training Evaluation](http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/isd/kirkpatrick.html). Do yourself a favor and skip past the audio problems that the combatants were having and get to the good stuff. Thanks to [Brent Schlenker](https://twitter.com/bschlenker) for hosting/refereeing this tête-á-tête. I'm happy to see Brent push us into more video, especially in the form of [Meerkat](http://meerkatapp.co/) streams.

* Discussion with [Rustici Software](http://rusticisoftware.com/)'s [Brian Miller](https://twitter.com/k95bm01) about how we - those who evangelize the technology - are maybe putting the cart before the horse. Brian was kind enough to drop [this gem](https://twitter.com/oxala75/status/584075345684537344) (which deserved the kind of honor that only erasable-marker-on-window can bestow)
* [This tweet](https://twitter.com/oxala75/status/584067118640959488). [drops mic]
