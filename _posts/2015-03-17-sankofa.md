Finally sat down to watch [Sankofa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108041/) this evening and...I don't know. 

So many questions:

* Brother Shango ([Xang√¥](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shango)?) held a machete for a good half of the movie, and didn't cut a single person. Disappointed.
* Where in the U.S. was this plantation? There weren't very many successful maroon colonies in the U.S., IIRC (though I suppose that you could say that the cave folks didn't quite comprise a colony).
* Is Crazy Joe supposed to be a *literally* tragic mulatto? 
* Why is everyone speaking as if they were from their respective countries in the 1990s?
* Why could I never like Shola?
* Why did this whole thing seem like a stage play that wandered out of doors?
* Should I just have re-read [*Kindred*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel))? I feel like the answer is 'yes.'
